HackPrinceton project!

__Inspiration:__ Imagine you are in a car with your friends and they want to share music with you. Usually, you would need to unplug your phone from the auxiliary and let your friends take turns. This idea and simple demo illustrates how to fix that issue. By having one general link and have the others connect to it, they can submit a song they want, using a youtube link, and it will then get posted on the queue. When a song finishes playing, it will play the next song on queue. Simple and easy!
